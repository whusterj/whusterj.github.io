    These days I'm learning Japanese and Morse Code. I set up a <a href="https://www.chia.net/" target="_blank">Chia (XCH)</a> farm last week for funsies, and I recently reinvented my entire personal task management system by migrating away from Google Tasks to <a href="https://amazingmarvin.com/" target="_blank">Amazing Marvin</a>, and I'm really digging it so far.
