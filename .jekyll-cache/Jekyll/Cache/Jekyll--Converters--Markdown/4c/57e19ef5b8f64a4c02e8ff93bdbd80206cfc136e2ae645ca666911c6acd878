I"N<p>So the band has been debating the best approach for ‘getting ourselves out there.’ At this point, we’re just trying every possible route and seeing how it goes. So far the band has accumulated some good experience. We’ve played at a couple bars and a club as well as several house parties. Our favorite venue (and best show) so far was 902’s down on Kirkwood. The sound guy there was excellent. It’s probably the only gig where everyone on stage could hear themselves AND everyone else, which is of course very important.</p>

<p>Besides live shows, a band is nothing without some recordings to show off. In late February we visited a professional studio and cut a few rough tracks. We’ll be going back in a few weeks to finish them up, but at the moment we have a few rough mixes and a lot of ideas on how to improve them. We’re talking about a free pre-release of the rough cuts so that people can preview the sound, but no promises! Though if you e-mail me, I’ll probably send you a copy, cuz I’m such a nice guy.</p>

<p>Anyway, you may have already noticed a new little widget to your right. I threw a track in there, too. It’s my own cover of “Mad World.” The chords and lyrics aren’t mine, of course, but I worked out the arrangement of all the parts and played them on my various instruments. I wasn’t trying to do anything groundbreaking. I know there are a lot of better covers of this beautiful song out there. Mainly, I was experimenting with some vocal layering and trying to get the best sound possible out of my equipment. I think it turned out pretty nice for an afternoon project. Let me know what you think!</p>

<p>Over the next few days, I’ll be putting some more tracks up, so come back and visit!</p>
