I"è<p>Short answer: <strong>donâ€™t</strong>. Managing whitespace in plain text templates is a headache-and-a-halfâ€¦</p>

<p>God forbid you should want your template to have some <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code> statements or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">for</code> loops! Suddenly you have a steamy, tangled mess on your hands.</p>

<p>Writing and maintaining templates in non-whitespace-sensitive HTML is faaar more sane. So my advice: write your template in HTML, render it to a string, and then use the html2text library to convert the rendered HTML to plaintext.</p>

<p>html2text actually renders the result as markdown, which applies pretty sensible and readable formatting, even for non-technical recipients.</p>

<p>Ideally, of course, you should be sending HTML in almost every case anyway. But you still always need plain text as a fallback. Well, now you have an easy way to generate that fallback â€“ without any need to maintain both an HTML and plain text template.</p>
