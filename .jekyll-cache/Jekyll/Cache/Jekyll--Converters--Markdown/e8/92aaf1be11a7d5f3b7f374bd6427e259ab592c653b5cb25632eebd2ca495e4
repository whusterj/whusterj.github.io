I"Æ<p>The State of JS survey and results have been collected and published every year for the past 6 years or so. I have responded a few times, but not this year. Their design and data visualization skills are top-notch. Itâ€™s always an interesting and informative read. I often refer to it when clients ask me why we are/are not using framework XYZ. Thatâ€™s JS-only, of course, but a quick Google can get you similar survey results for other topics.</p>
