I"¿<p>Since I have been doing a lot of 3D work this semester, I thought I would share a little bit of what Iâ€™m working on. In Margaret Dolinskyâ€™s 3D Graphical Environments course, I am working on an environment inspired by the time I spent in El Salvador, living in a little cinder block house with my friend Chamba.</p>

<p>Here are a few renders of the work in progress.</p>

<p>And hereâ€™s the environment (EDIT 2018-01-11: This link is unfortunately dead). I havenâ€™t had a chance to optimize for the web, yet. So only click the link if you have some time, patience, and a solid internet connection. Also, you will need to download the 3DVia player in order to view the file. A link to the download site should be provided if you donâ€™t have it, yet.</p>
