I"v<p>Long time, no update. There is a lot to tell! Those of you who have visited the site before have probably noticed the tab “Social Entrepreneurship,” and you most likely also asked yourself, “What’s that about?” Now you get to find out!</p>

<p>I’m spending this summer in muggy Washington, D.C. working on a non-profit project with my good friend Neil Shah, and many other amazing people. The organization is called Compass Partners, and it’s going to be huge! The full-time staffers are living together at our three-story “Compass HQ,” working from the house and our D.C. office locations. We are already well off the ground with financial backing from the Prudential Foundation, a year of the Compass Fellowship at Georgetown under our belt, and expansion slated for up to three schools in the coming fall semester, including, mayhaps, Indiana University.</p>

<p>Let me give you a little overview, in my own words, of what the program is about and my role in it.</p>

<p>If you are unfamiliar with the term “Social Entrepreneurship,” don’t fret! Just to clear the air ahead of time, though, it has nothing to do with social events - though our community is certainly one of the keys to our success. Even though social businesses are all around us, the term is simply not widely understood – yet. In recent years, the movement has gained more widespread awareness. Actually, if you think about it, words like “green” and “organic” had to undergo similar transformations before they came to represent the kinds of societal and ecological benefits that they stand for today. Expediting the spread of the social business philosophy is definitely one of our main goals.</p>

<p>Social Entrepreneurship, most simply put, is the creation of businesses intent upon improving some aspect of society. This social mission exists in addition to the usual requirements of running a business, like making a profit. For this reason, social businesses are said to have a “triple bottom line,” that is the double-bottom line of the balance sheet plus the stated social goal.</p>

<p>Businesses touting green practices are perhaps the most familiar examples of socially responsible business today. It is important to note, however, that social business is more than a one-off marketing campaign. A true social business aims for both sustained social impact and sustained financial success. Another important thing to understand about social business is that they do not have to be non-profit or charity-based to succeed. In fact, the revolutionary concept behind the new social business philosophy is that effective, sustainable businesses may be better equipped to create positive social impact than the traditional avenues of social aid, such as charities and non-profits.</p>

<p>Toms shoes is an excellent example of a social business that thrives both as a financially feasible business and a purveyor of social good.</p>

<p>Everybody living here at Compass HQ, believes that we are on the forefront of a major movement. Fresh from college, we are tapping into social entrepreneurship’s greatest wellspring of future talent: passionate young people. In a nutshell,Compass targets college campuses with its fellowship program and incubation services, putting immense resources into students’ hands to create new social businesses of their own.</p>

<p>As an education organization, however, our ultimate aim is not necessarily to create successful businesses but successful people. Lately, we’ve been using the Institute for the Future’s apt phrase: “Super-Empowered Hopeful Individuals” to describe exactly the kind of future entrepreneurs our programs will produce.</p>

<p>So what’s my role in all of this?</p>

<p>Neil and I have been heading up the marketing and branding team at HQ. I spent the better part of the past two weeks putting together our first self-produced promotional video. This video is a brief overview of Compass’s core educational program, the Compass Fellowship. It also serves as an introduction to our website.</p>
