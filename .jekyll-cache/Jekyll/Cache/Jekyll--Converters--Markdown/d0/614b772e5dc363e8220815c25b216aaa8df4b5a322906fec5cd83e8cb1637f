I"h<p>Here’s a little gem I just dug out of my past.</p>

<p>A few years ago, a good friend of mine and I wrote a short play for the Indianapolis Fringe festival called “Global Warming Cabaret.” We played two NASA scientists who were recently let go because of their unpopular views on global warming. Naturally, these ex-researchers began touring the country with nothing but an accordion and some passion, performing heart-warming ditties about the imminent dangers of climate change. We wrote and performed parodies of popular songs (my favorite was: “You Can Call Me Al (Gore)”). It was a lot of fun mocking both the preachy radical left and intractable right.</p>

<p>We even got a nice little write-up in the local newspaper.</p>

<p>We made the following nifty little parody video to play at intermission in an overdrawn film noir detective story style.</p>
