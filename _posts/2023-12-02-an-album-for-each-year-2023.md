I love lists. So here's a list albums, one for each year of my life. This exercise was inspired by [a blog post by the CTO of Amazon, Dr. Werner Vogels](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2008/07/an_album_for_each_year.html).

The rules are simple, Select “a favorite album for every year of your life”. The challenge had two restrictions:

1. Only one album per year
2. No repeat artists

I'm probably profiling myself pretty heavily by sharing this list, but who cares! I won't go through them all, but I have a meaningful memory attached to each of these albums. My 2023 album of choice is a particularly weird and delightful one: "One Wayne G" by Mac Demarco. This album is actually an archive of musical sketches and experiments. The songs are not really complete or cohesive, but they have Mac's signature style and are all pleasant to listen to. The titles of the songs are mostly just dates, like "20221102." I found this really inspirational. I ended up doing a few similar musical experiments this year because of this album. Titling song sketches with a date is liberating, because it relieves the pressure of trying to _make a complete song_.

One of my favorite songs on the album actually does have a title: _Proud, True Toyota_. It's hilarious and speaks to me, because I too own a proud, true, Toyota Tundra. The song is ridiculous, and it's also ridiculous that I live in Washington DC and own an old pickup truck! It's honestly not very smart or convenient, but it makes me happy.

Finally, the album will also always reminds me of my mom who passed away this year. I was playing the album through my bluetooth speakers at home with her in May, around Mother's day. That was just a few weeks before she died on June 7.
