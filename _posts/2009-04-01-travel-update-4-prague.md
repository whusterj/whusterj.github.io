Finally a place in Europe with a sensible WiFi connection (that is, a free one): Sir Toby's Hostel in Prague.

Yes, I've been out of the country for over a month now, and we are only now reaching Travel Update #4. So much for diligence.

I'm going to go ahead and make a list of things I should tell you about. And then I expect you'll send me an e-mail everyday reminding me to elaborate:

1. Host Family
2. Trip to Warnemuende
3. Trip to Prague
4. School, Schedules
5. Daily Life
6. Everything Else!

Alright, enough already! Assignments, assignments. Everything in it's own good time.

In the meantime, here are some images from Prague!
