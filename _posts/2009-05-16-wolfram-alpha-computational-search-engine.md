Okay, all the blogs have been buzzing about this being the "future of the internet," and I've ignored it up until now. Today, I finally caved to the mountain of links asking me to take a look, and I was very impressed. I think everyone should definitely see this.

Wolfram Alpha is a new kind of computational search engine. Some people think it's going to save Google from anti-trust lawsuits, because of the potentially stiff competition that the idea offers. Check it out this video first: [Introduction to Wolfram Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/screencast/introducingwolframalpha.html)

And then try out Wolfram Alpha for yourself here (that's right, it's already available in its baby form): [Wolfram Alpha Home](http://www.wolframalpha.com/)

As the guy points out, the engine is in it's early stages, but that doesn't make it any less WOW. :)
