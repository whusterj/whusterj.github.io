Alright, I know I've been promising it for a while, but I finally got around to uploading some pictures. It's been a grueling process, but I think it was worth it!

**2023-12-11 Update:** I originally posted my pictures to Picasa, but Google killed Picasa and that album is gone. I've migrated my pictures to Google Photos here:

[Google Photos Album: Germany 2009](https://photos.app.goo.gl/P5zXDkmy6AGK5UoK6)
