In addition to the hi-def images from my new camera, I've been taking some low-definition photos with my cell-phone. I finally took some time to upload them. There's something nice about just taking an image and sending it "straight to press" ... something old-fashioned, like taking pictures with a disposable camera, and just accepting the output.

Some really neat effects also happened as a result of the fact that the camera is built into the body of the phone, which has become really scratched up, diffusing light sources to a glow and blurring edges.
