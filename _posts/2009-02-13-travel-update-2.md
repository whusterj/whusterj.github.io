It's getting down to the wire! My bags are neatly packed, and tonight I'll drive to Indianapolis to spend the last couple days with my family before I fly to Germany on Sunday.

There's not much more I have to say now, except: can you believe that Barnes & Noble had absolutely no guidebooks in stock on Germany or Berlin!? I found detailed maps of Paris, Rome, London, even Prague. I can only conclude that Berlin must be a popular destination. :P

Oh, well. I'll take a look at the bookstores in Carmel. Maybe someone knows where I can get good paper maps of foreign cities?
