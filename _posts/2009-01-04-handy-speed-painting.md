Digital Art at last! I found a post over at Gizmodo about speed painting on the iPhone. This is something I had honestly never considered, but there are many more Youtube videos of speed painting on portable devices. On the iPhone, the app used is called "Brushes." It looks like Corel Painter also has a portable version of their software.
