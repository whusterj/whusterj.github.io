They analyzed his blood and found a speck. He didn't need to know - yet. He still had several years before it would become an issue. Several productive years at a good income. The data was all there. Let him sow and later we'll reap. That will all be harvested. It's a simple calculation. Let him continue to be motivated and untroubled by health. Earning until the disease really takes hold. Then we can transfer the wealth away. He won't miss it, after all. As he wanes he will turn his attention to other things. Family and the few precious moments he has left. He will pay whatever it takes to extend that time. He won't miss it. That's when we'll cash in.
