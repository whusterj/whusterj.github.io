My favorite albums for each year of my life. Inspired by: https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2008/07/an_album_for_each_year.html CTO of Amazon DR. WERNER VOGELS

IDEA: Could also do a SONG for each year. Albums are unfortunately not much of a relevant concept anymore, although I am very attached to albums from prior to my birth like all of Pink Floyd's catalogue.

The rules “a favorite album for every year of your life”. The challenge had two restrictions:

1. Only one album per year
2. No repeat artists
