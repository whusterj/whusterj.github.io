Finally a place in Europe with a sensible WiFi connection (that is, a free one): Sir Toby's Hostel in Prague.

Yes, I've been out of the country for over a month now, and we are only now reaching Travel Update #3. So much for diligence.

I'm going to go ahead and make a list of things I should tell you about. And then I expect you'll send me an e-mail everyday reminding me to elaborate:  

1. Host Family  
2. Trip to Warnemuende  
3. Trip to Prague  
4. School, Schedules  
5. Daily Life  
6. Everything Else!

Alright, enough already! Assignments, assignments. Everything in it's own good time.
