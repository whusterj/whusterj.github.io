A recent feature on Youtube, and how interesting! Val has turned her paintings into a brand. She is taking full advantage of social networking sites Youtube, Facebook, and Twitter. She has almost 500 fans already!  

Just look at herÂ [website](http://www.valsartdiary.com/valsartdiary/Welcome.html)! (2023-12-11 Update: [Val's Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@valsartdiary/videos) has been inactive for a while and her website is down, but she is still active on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/valsartdiary/).

Naturally, she's very photogenic and has a wonderfully cute accent, making her an ideal Youtube star. And she uses an HD camera - she beat me to it! I think she's found a very profitable niche.

Oh, and the art! Well, it's not at all bad, to boot. Way to go, Val!

It just goes to show how easy it is to gain exposure nowadays. Not that it's ever going to be easy to deliver quality content.
