Since I have been doing a lot of 3D work this semester, I thought I would share a little bit of what I'm working on. In Margaret Dolinsky's 3D Graphical Environments course, I am working on an environment inspired by the time I spent in El Salvador, living in a little cinder block house with my friend Chamba.

Here are a few renders of the work in progress.

And here's the environment (EDIT 2018-01-11: This link is unfortunately dead). I haven't had a chance to optimize for the web, yet. So only click the link if you have some time, patience, and a solid internet connection. Also, you will need to download the 3DVia player in order to view the file. A link to the download site should be provided if you don't have it, yet.
