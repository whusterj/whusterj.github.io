So much for habitual updates!

Actually, my cat chewed up the internet cable Typical!

My plans are set for the next month, so I thought I might relate them here.

I'm going to spend the next two weeks in Washington, D.C. I've a **new goal to make a video every week,** so I'm thinking about putting together an inauguration video. Tonight I am at my parent's house in Indianapolis. Tomorrow night, I will be at Georgetown U. with my ol' buddy Neil.

Since I have this time off before I leave for Germany, I've decided to spend some of it with my friends out at Georgetown. Besides hanging out when they're not in class, I'll be doing some work on our not-for-profit project, Compass Consulting, which I'll write more about in the next post.

I'll be back in Bloomington around the 30th. Then I have half of February to relax. Of course, I'll be preparing for my travels (departure date: February 15th), but more importantly, Sylvia's birthday is coming up, and then there is Valentine's Day.

Well, I have a long drive ahead of me....
